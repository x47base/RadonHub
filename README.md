## Executors
### Why you need a good executor?
You need a good quality executor for Radon's needs. Without a good executor, Roblox might crash or Radon might get an error. If it does get an error its because your executor doesnt have the required `Lua` Functions expected by Radon.

Radon should be able to be used with the most executors.

### Popular Executors

- Synapse is the **best** executor in the community, It can run all scripts, Its the best executor to work with, All though its `paid`, Its an amazing executor! You can download from here : [Synapse](https://x.synapse.to/)

#### **Script-Ware**
- Script-Ware is also one of the best. It almost has the same execution power as Synapse, It can run **99%** of all scripts, Synapse wins only because there are some 'Synapse Only Scripts'. Forgot to mention that it is `Paid`, You can download here : [Script-Ware](https://Script-Ware.com)
